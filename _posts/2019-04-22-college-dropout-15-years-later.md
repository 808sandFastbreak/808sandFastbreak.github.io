<i> The College Dropout </i> was the first, of now eight, studio albums by Kanye West, released in February 2004. 
With the album, West brought a new style of music into the hip hop scene, notably featuring sped-up soul samples and 
conscious lyrics instead of mainstream, gangster rap. 15 years later, the album still stands as one of the greatest rap 
albums ever released.


<b> Background </b>


Growing up in Chicago, Kanye West was always musically gifted. West dropped out of Chicago State University to focus on a 
music career, and received his big break when he was hired as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in 2000. He was a primary 
producer for Jay-Z’s widely-acclaimed project, <i> The Blueprint </i>, bringing soul samples into the mainstream and 
generating a lot of interest in West for his production talents.


However, West aspired to become a rapper, and after rejections from several record labels, Roc-A-Fella Records signed him 
to a deal. 


<b> Story </b>


One of the strengths of <i> Dropout </i> is its introspective and relatable story. As demonstrated in Kanye’s background, 
he has always rejected the status quo in favor of his own ideas, from dropping out of a college at which his mother was 
a professor, introducing a new sound into mainstream music, and aiming to be a rapper without the gangster image of his
contemporaries.


The album revolves around staying true to oneself and pokes fun at conventional thought. In tracks at the beginning, 
such as <i>We Don’t Care</i> and <i>Spaceship</i>, West expresses who he wants to be, and in later tracks, as in 
<i>Jesus Walks</i> and <i>Never Let Me Down</i>, he expresses the uniqueness in his music, by being willing to rap about 
his faith and racism, respectively. The skits throughout the album satirize the college system by mocking the value of a 
degree and the “career students” who collect them. West wraps up the album with <i>Last Call</i>, describing his personal 
story and calling the audience to reject the status quo.


<b> Flow </b>


One unique part of <i>The College Dropout</i> is the skits: no music, just people speaking. It provides a 
comedic effect and adds to the consciousness to the album. Most of all, these parts weave songs together and 
avoid abrupt transitions. In the introduction, a professor speaks about West needing to make a song, which 
easily transitions to the song <i>We Don’t Care</i>. 
Also, in <i>Workout Plan</i>, there are three women talking with each other, and one brings up her workout plan that she is 
using that got her in shape, which leads to the song <i>The New Workout Plan</i>. The <i>Lil Jimmy Skit</i> and 
other skits about 
school spirit describe people with many degrees, but nothing more than that, a literal jab at the college system.


<b> Style </b>


<i>Dropout</i> was distinct because it deviated from the popular styles of the day, a la Ice Cube, 
Mac Dre, Snoop Dogg, Jay-Z, etc. 
West instead used a much more light-hearted technique, featuring more singing and joke-telling. However, the subject matter 
remained serious, and appealed to a different set of ears than gangster-rap did. Soon, others started emulating the styles and 
themes we see in this project.


<b> First Impression </b>


My first impression was that this album felt more like a book than a collection of songs. The smooth transitions between 
tracks, the skits, and the blending of light-hearted elements with deeply aware topics elevated my listening experience. 
A personal favorite lyric: “She got a light-skinned friend look like Michael Jackson / She got a dark-skinned friend look 
like Michael Jackson.”


<b> What Stands Out </b>


As stated before, this album is successful for its comedic flair, but what really stands out are the powerful songs 
like <i>Through The Wire</i> and <i>Jesus Walks</i>. <i>Through The Wire</i> was a song written and recorded in 2002 when West was 
hospitalized after falling asleep at the wheel and having his jaw wired shut, and synthesizes his frustration at being 
labeled as a producer, while highlighting his extreme self-confidence, which is very evident nowadays. <i>Jesus Walks</i> stood 
out due its modern take on what it means to be religious in the 21st century - loving Jesus even though West “hasn’t spoken 
[to him] in so long.”

<i>The College Dropout</i> is a 10/10. 15 years later, the tracks have aged well, the themes are still relevant, and the impact it has had 
on popular music is evident, with more conscious and emotional rappers gaining popularity, like J. Cole, Kendrick Lamar, etc.
