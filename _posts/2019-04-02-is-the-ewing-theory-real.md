The Ewing theory describes the phenomenon when a team plays better without its star player, 
named after former Knicks superstar Patrick Ewing, whose teams seemed to play better when 
he was injured or in foul trouble.


Over this past NBA season, the Celtics have seen more success when Kyrie is not playing, for example. 
The Pacers have kept in the playoff race without Victor Oladipo for the second half of the season. 
However, some other teams have suffered without their star player, such as Anthony Davis and the 
Pelicans. Is the Ewing theory plausible and what circumstances cause it?

As seen, the Celtics have had a greater winning percentage (84.6%, 11-2 overall) when Kyrie Irving 
does not play, as opposed to when he does (54.0%, 34-21 overall). In contrast, the Pelicans have had 
a greater winning percentage (44.6%, 25-31 overall) when Anthony Davis does play, as opposed to when
he does not (33.3%, 7-14 overall).


To explore this trend, we can compare the two players' value over replacement player (VORP), which 
measures a player's contribution to the team compared to the "replacement player" value of -2.0, 
calculated by taking the difference of a player's total box plus/minus and -2.0, and multiplying it 
by the percentage of minutes played.

As shown, Davis has slightly higher VORP and win share values, but as he is ranked 10th in the league 
compared to Irving ranking 13th in VORP, and Davis ranking 10th compared to Irving ranking 15th in win 
shares, further data needs to be explored to examine the Ewing theory fully.


The Celtics and Pelicans need to be compared to determine if team trends affect play without star power. 
In the following chart, the net difference between the team's statistics when the player is on the court 
and when the player is off the court is described for assist rate, offensive rating, defensive rating, 
and effective field goal percentage (which counts a three-pointer as 1.5 of a field goal and factors in free throws).

As seen, the Celtics, when Irving is either out or on the bench, have a higher assist rate and defensive 
rating, while Davis' absence brings lower ratings in all the above categories.


We can examine the differences in team assist rate and defensive ratings for other star players who have 
missed significant time (at least 10%) this season when they are on vs. off the court, compared to the 
difference in win percentage with them on the court instead of off.

For these three players, the trend seems to hold, even though all three rank in the top 20 in the league 
for VORP, and Leonard is tied with Curry in win shares and ahead of James.


To test this further, I compared Kevin Durant's 2014-15 season, in which his injury dropped the Oklahoma 
City Thunder to the 9th seed with a 45-37 record after a 59-23 finish with the same team from the year 
prior, to Kevin Durant's 2017-18 season, in which the Warriors went undefeated in the 8 games he didn't 
play when either Curry or Thompson played, and his own play caused frustrations within the team (i.e. 
loss to Memphis in January).

The trends seem to hold for the same player, further demonstrating that team statistics are a viable 
measure. Team make-up and strategy should factor into any Ewing theory explanations, as a lower assist 
rate when off the court highlights greater isolation play and a less favorable defensive rating indicates 
a stronger presence when a substitute is played.


With that in mind, we can analyze the leading scorers of current playoff-bound NBA teams 
(for which players weren't already examined) to assess which teams may "inexplicably" play better 
without them.

As seen, if the trend holds, Ewing-esque effects could happen to the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio Spurs, 
and Houston Rockets if Blake Griffin, DeMar DeRozan, and/or James Harden, respectively, go down. 


In their five games without Griffin, the Pistons have gone 1-4, but had a late season win against the 
playoff-bound Portland Trail Blazers. Without DeRozan, the Spurs have gone 4-1, with their only loss 
against the currently top-seeded Warriors on the road. Without Harden, the Rockets have gone 2-2, 
although the two losses came when now-teamless Carmelo Anthony was starting, and one of those wins came 
against a full-strength Warriors in Oakland.


This trend can serve to explain why some teams seem to play better without their leading scorer and others 
do not. Although individual statistics are similar between different cases, the supporting team's play 
affects the performance without the star. If the star prevents assists and worsens the defensive play, 
the supporting cast may fare well without him.


This entire analysis was done for leading scorers of teams. Teams may also play "better" without secondary 
players, such as Rajon Rondo's injury in the 2012-13 season, which saw the Boston Celtics reach the 
playoffs and play at a higher win percentage after his departure, despite a lower assist rate and worse 
defensive performance in terms of defensive rating.
